# Urbit FAQ

This repo contains non-trivial info that I have asked or have seen others ask, as well as the answers we received. At
one time it contained more information, but much of it has been documented in
[the main Urbit docs](https://developers.urbit.org). The ultimate goal is to have all of this information in the main
docs/guides, one day. Until then, the goals of this repo are:

1. Help new Hoon devs and Urbit pilots
2. Prevent Hoon/Urbit long-beards from answering the same questions over and over
3. Catalogue rare information so that it doesn't fall through the cracks

Where possible, I've included the source of the information, additional sources that provide context, and a place in the
docs where I think this information should be documented.
