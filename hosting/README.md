### Monitoring uptime of ships

Using the script available [here](https://github.com/mrdomino/urbit-sysops/blob/master/sbin/urbit-exporter), you can
set up [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) to monitor any number of running Urbit instances. Prometheus is a re-write
of Borgmon, a Google-internal, time-series monitoring system.

### Star: Hosting on a Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi would work for hosting a star, depending on what else is running on the Pi, competing with Urbit for
RAM and SD reader access. Most likely, you would want a Pi with 4GB+ RAM and an SSD attached by USB.
